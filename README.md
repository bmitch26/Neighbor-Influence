# Neighbor Influence (NetLogo)
The following project attempts to simulate how neighboring individuals may influence one another. To model this scenario, a number of individuals are generated in a population and are assigned any random color encompassing entire color wheel. Then, two settings can be chosen from: a 'maximum influence effect', or an 'influence one another' effect. If 'maximum influence effect' is chosen, then the individual with the highest influence in a neighboring region will cause all of the other individuals in a population to become like them. If 'influence one another' effect is chosen, then neighboring individuals will change the color of one another as a percentage of their amount of influence compared to the mean number of influence of all neighbors and a susceptibility variable.
